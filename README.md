# Ultra-Low Latency Class Roster App

Welcome to the **Ultra-Low Latency Class Roster App**! 🎓🚀

This application is built in **C++** with a focus on ultra-low latency and high-performance operations, designed to handle real-time class roster management. Whether you're enrolling students, removing them, or just viewing the current roster, everything happens with minimal delay. Perfect for applications that require lightning-fast, concurrent interactions, like in large classrooms or educational institutions.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Ultra-Low Latency**: Optimized for speed in enrolling, removing, and viewing student data.
- **Efficient Data Management**: Uses high-performance data structures (like `std::unordered_map` and `std::vector`) for fast lookups and memory efficiency.
- **Real-Time Operations**: Supports multiple simultaneous actions without performance degradation.
- **Minimal Memory Footprint**: Efficient memory usage and management for high-concurrency operations.

## 🖥️ Technologies

- **C++**: The core language to achieve speed and low-latency operations.
- **STL** (Standard Template Library): Leveraging efficient containers and algorithms to minimize latency.
- **Multi-threading**: Implemented for handling multiple operations concurrently with minimal delay.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get up and running with the project:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ultra-low-latency-class-roster.git
```

### Step 2: Build the Application

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed. Then, compile the code using:

```bash
g++ -o roster_app main.cpp -std=c++17 -pthread
```

### Step 3: Run the Application

Once compiled, run the app with:

```bash
./roster_app
```

## 📝 Usage

- **Add a Student**: `addStudent <name> <ID>`
- **Remove a Student**: `removeStudent <ID>`
- **View Roster**: `viewRoster`

### Example Commands

Add a student:

```bash
addStudent JohnDoe 12345
```

Remove a student:

```bash
removeStudent 12345
```

View the current roster:

```bash
viewRoster
```
